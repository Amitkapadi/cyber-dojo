Trying to put rails-app code into its own data-container.
Should be able to make it a ro volumes-from in docker-compose.yml
Also, means separate dev based way to run server is with rails-app code volume-mounted.

Fails though. Server comes up
couldn't find file 'jquery'
  (in /usr/src/cyber-dojo/app/assets/javascripts/application.js:16)

I think jquery needs to be a locally installed js file.

$ rails console
$ Rails.application.config.assets.paths
["/private/var/www/cyber-dojo/app/assets/images",
 "/private/var/www/cyber-dojo/app/assets/javascripts",
 "/private/var/www/cyber-dojo/app/assets/stylesheets",
 "/Users/jonjagger/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/gems/jquery-rails-2.1.3/vendor/assets/javascripts"]

Got to be the last one
$ cd /Users/jonjagger/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/gems/jquery-rails-2.1.3/vendor/assets/javascripts
$ ls

total 1872

-rw-r--r--  1 jonjagger  staff   17894 21 Feb  2015 jquery_ujs.js

So I guess I can just copy them across!
Did that.

Removed the entries from application.js
-//= require jquery
-//= require jquery_ujs
-//= require jquery-ui

Removed the gem from Gemfile
-gem 'jquery-rails', '2.1.3'

Rebuilding...
Main page now comes up.
But click on [create a practice session] and nothing happens.
Javascript console says its

})(cyberDojo || {}, $);

and $ is Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
I think $ needs to be replaced with jQuery
