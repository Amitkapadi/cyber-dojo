Trying to put rails-app code into its own data-container.
Should be able to make it a ro volumes-from in docker-compose.yml
Also, means separate dev based way to run server is with rails-app code volume-mounted.

Fails though. Server comes up
couldn't find file 'jquery'
  (in /usr/src/cyber-dojo/app/assets/javascripts/application.js:16)

I think jquery needs to be a locally installed js file.
