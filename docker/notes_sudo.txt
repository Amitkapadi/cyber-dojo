inside web container, I'd like to run as
user=cyber-dojo    INSIDE the web container    [NO dependency on host]
in sudoers         INSIDE the web container    [NO dependency on host]

Confirmed it works by deleting default image and reinstalling fresh Docker-Toolbox
$ docker-machine ssh default
$ id cyber-dojo
confirms no cyber-dojo user on default

cyber-dojo being able to write to katas/... is a separate issue.

TODO: limit sudo operation to docker executable
