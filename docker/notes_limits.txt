I tried setting --cpu-shares=256 --ulimit fsize=1024 in
lib/docker_katas_data_container_runner.sh

CID=$(${SUDO} docker run --detach \
                         --interactive \
                         --net=none \
                         --user=nobody \
                         --cpu-shares=256 \
                         --ulimit fsize=1024 \
                         ${IMAGE} sh)

inside the container doing a
$ ulimit -a
shows that the settings are being ignored.

I think that's because changing ulimits in a container would affect the host too
which is regarded as security risk so they can't.
They have to be set on the host.
That's not so good...
