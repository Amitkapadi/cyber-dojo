If katas is a (linked) data-container I can control its rights in its Dockerfile.
I can't restrict access to katas/ sub-folder but I don't need to.
I don't need to for katas-runner either (assuming I tar files both ways)

What about the one-time *creation* of the data-container?
That's ok too since I'm copying them. Just need read-access.

The data-container can be made FROM the web container.
This will ensure it has the same cyber-dojo user.
Does it increase the data-container size? Read this just recently.
Using Docker, p54
Or use base image with cyber-dojo user?


Maybe have two yml files?

  tmp: Probe for katas folder, temporarily copy katas-data-container Dockerfile
       into katas, copy it, make sure its owned by cyber-dojo.

  katas: volume-mount katas folder - still needs to be writable by cyber-dojo user
         as identified on the *host*.
