DockerTmpRunner vs DockerKatasRunner

Both need to write to katas/

Suppose katas was a data-container.
It only doesn't need to be a data-container for James' style of use
where files are re-used from katas folder and for security I need to
stop the cyber-dojo.sh file from doing cd ../../../; rm -rf *

Maybe have two yml files?
  tmp: Probe for katas folder, temporarily copy katas-data-container Dockerfile
       into katas, copy it, make sure its owned by cyber-dojo.
  katas: volume-mount katas folder - still needs to be writable by cyber-dojo user
         as identified on the *host*.
