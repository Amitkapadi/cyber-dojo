Add file for OSX too (sw_vers is the command)
On OSX Docker-Quickstart-Terminal you will need to...
$ docker-machine ssh default
run commands from there (which ones? what is default based on?)
Answer=Tiny Core. Has sh not bash

Does pull.sh still do an image update check?
It still calls caches/refresh_all.sh *after* the git pull.
So refresh_all could be updated to reinstate the image update.

There is a --tmpfs option on docker run. Look into that.

volume mount has ro,rw and also other options, eg z for sharing.

0. On old blog pages add links to new blog pages and say old pages are deprecated.

1. Add new blog page on installing dind server.

   As root install the main cyber-dojo 'shell' script
   $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo/master/docker/cyber-dojo
   $ chmod +x it

   Type
   $ ./cyber-dojo
   If docker is not installed the script will list the installation commands
   taken from the Docker website. You can run these manually or, to get the
   cyber-dojo shell script to run them for you, type

   $ ./cyber-dojo install_docker

   Now you can bring up your cyber-dojo server.
   If this is a brand new cyber-dojo installation just type

   $ ./cyber-dojo up

   If there is already a cyber-dojo server on the host, type

   $ ./cyber-dojo up katas=PATH

   replacing PATH with the location of your katas folder. For example

   $ ./cyber-dojo up katas=/var/www/cyber-dojo/katas
