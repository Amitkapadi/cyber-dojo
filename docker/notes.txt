   but only if they are not set.

0. Get tests all working

0. Add test to languages that looks for sandbox as explicit path
   in cyber-dojo.sh files.

=======================================================================
Major

Dev
0. Add dev info to main github readme
0. running local-server
0. running dind server with app volume-mounted (fast feedback) ?????
   This implies web and app are split into two. Mostly.
   The Gemfile and its bundle are inside the image.
   But all the app files are either in another ro image or they
   are volume-mounted.
0. running 'proper' dind server

=======================================================================
Minor

Does pull.sh still do an image update check?
It still calls caches/refresh_all.sh *after* the git pull.
So refresh_all could be updated to reinstate the image update.

There is a --tmpfs option on docker run. Look into that.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/ (look for :z)

volume mount has ro,rw and also other options, eg z for sharing.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/ (look for z option)

0. Make cyber-dojo script auto-probe for/var/www/cyber-dojo/katas
   and if it finds it use that as katas home.

0. ????? Where to have katas default to when /var/www/cyber-dojo/katas not detected

0. create name for web container so its easy to refer to in cdf/cyber-dojo scripts
0. create names for ALL cdf containers so they can be filtered
0. tidy up .gitignore - follow .dockerignore model, ignore everything, except....
0. Move coverage/ out of root?
0. Move docker/ out of root?
0. Move zips/ out of root?
0. set prompt to display hostname inside web container
   This is tricky. Can create a .profile by adding this line to Dockerfile
   RUN echo 'export PS1="[\u@docker] \W # "' >> /root/.profile
   But how to run it?
   Can't see a way to add it to web:command
   Can't see a way to add it to docker exec -it docker_web_1 sh
0. Put test/ into data-container?

0. http://www.jrslv.com/docker-1-10/ Says
Resource constraints can be applied on disk I/O. Investigate

Also, multiple logs
    cyber-dojo logs_rails
    cyber-dojo logs_web
    cyber-dojo logs_nginx
Or just do single logs command and grep afterwards if you want.
