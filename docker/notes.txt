Does pull.sh still do an image update check?
It still calls caches/refresh_all.sh *after* the git pull.
So refresh_all could be updated to reinstate the image update.

There is a --tmpfs option on docker run. Look into that.

volume mount has ro,rw and also other options, eg z for sharing.

TODO:

katas
1. Make cyber-dojo script auto-probe for/var/www/cyber-dojo/app/katas
   and if it finds it use that as katas home.

2. ????? Where to have katas default to when /var/www/cyber-dojo/app/katas not detected


0. create name for web container so its easy to refer to in cdf/cyber-dojo scripts
0. create names for ALL cdf containers so they can be filtered
0. tidy up .gitignore - follow .dockerignore model, ignore everything, except....
0. Move coverage/ out of root?
0. Move docker/ out of root?
0. Move zips/ out of root?
0. investigate docker run --tmpfs for web container
0. set prompt to display hostname inside web container
   This is tricky. Can create a .profile by adding this line to Dockerfile
   RUN echo 'export PS1="[\u@docker] \W # "' >> /root/.profile
   But how to run it?
   Can't see a way to add it to web:command
   Can't see a way to add it to docker exec -it docker_web_1 sh
0. Put languages/ into ro:data-container?
0. Put exercises/ into ro:data-container?
0. Put test/ into data-container?


1. Edit/drop? pull.sh
