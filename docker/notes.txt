drop timeout from Alpine
drop installing bash from Alpine
in new runner use probe into language image to see
  if its Ubuntu or Alpine and do command with timeout in if/else
  put this into trunk. Yes. This means I could make this be
  the runner for old style deployment (if you re-pull).
  It would work for both images. Maybe I should leave pull.sh in place
  but add a warning.


Add file for OSX too (sw_vers is the command)
On OSX Docker-Quickstart-Terminal you will need to...
$ docker-machine ssh default
run commands from there (which ones? what is default based on?)
Answer=Tiny Core. Has sh not bash

Does pull.sh still do an image update check?
It still calls caches/refresh_all.sh *after* the git pull.
So refresh_all could be updated to reinstate the image update.

There is a --tmpfs option on docker run. Look into that.

volume mount has ro,rw and also other options, eg z for sharing.
