Add file for OSX too (sw_vers is the command)
On OSX Docker-Quickstart-Terminal you will need to...
$ docker-machine ssh default
run commands from there (which ones? what is default based on?)
Answer=Tiny Core. Has sh not bash

Checkout the procedure on a Windows box too

Auto-detect which version of linux I'm on (lsb_release) ?


Keep the image names
--------------------
As opposed to, eg, making them all have an alpine prefix
   cyberdojofoundation/gcc_assert -> cyberdojofoundation/alpine_gcc_assert
If I keep the old-style names then someone on an old style server
will be ok if they do a admin_scripts/pull.sh but they don't
do a docker pull. Have to check that. Does it only rely on big old-style
images having bash and sh? It's a reasonable use case.

If they also do a docker pull they'll get a new smaller image.
Could it still work?
I think it could. On an old style server the runner will be
DockerTmpRunner with its own .sh file.
That could be updated as part of the pull.sh
I'd need to change the runner's sh file...
  o) change /bin/bash to /bin/sh
  o) change cidfile=`mktemp --tmpdir=/tmp cyber-dojo.XXXXX` to cidfile=`mktemp`
  o) change rm --force to rm -f (twice)
  o) change --signal=9 to -s 9
  o) change 10s to -t 10
  o) change "timeout ./cyber-dojo.sh" to "timeout sh -c ./cyber-dojo.sh"
This allows an old-style server to benefit from the smaller images.
Does pull.sh still do an image update check?
It still calls caches/refresh_all.sh *after* the git pull.
So refresh_all could be updated to reinstate the image update.

Old style servers run with user=www-data inside apache.
An old style server with new alpine based images will still be www-data.
So new alpine-based images have to work as www-data.
That way they work for old-style and new-style server.

Also, this way I don't double the number of images on the hub.
