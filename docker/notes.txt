Add file for OSX too (sw_vers is the command)
On OSX Docker-Quickstart-Terminal you will need to...
$ docker-machine ssh default
run commands from there (which ones? what is default based on?)
Answer=Tiny Core. Has sh not bash

Does pull.sh still do an image update check?
It still calls caches/refresh_all.sh *after* the git pull.
So refresh_all could be updated to reinstate the image update.

There is a --tmpfs option on docker run. Look into that.

volume mount has ro,rw and also other options, eg z for sharing.

TODO:

0. On old blog pages add links to new blog pages and say old pages are deprecated.

1. Add new blog page on installing dind server.

   As root install the main cyber-dojo 'shell' script
   $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo/master/docker/cyber-dojo
   $ chmod +x cyber-dojo

   Type
   $ ./cyber-dojo
   If docker is not installed the script will list the installation commands
   taken from the Docker website. You can run these manually or, to get the
   cyber-dojo shell script to run them for you, type
   $ ./cyber-dojo install_docker

   Now you can bring up your cyber-dojo server.
   If this is a brand new cyber-dojo installation just type
   $ ./cyber-dojo up
   EXAMPLE OUTPUT
   Your cyber-dojo server will have several common languages and test
   frameworks already setup. If you want to remove or add langages see below.

   If there is already a cyber-dojo server on the host,
   and you want your existing practice sessions to be visible
   in the new server, type
   $ ./cyber-dojo up katas=PATH
   replacing PATH with the location of your katas folder. For example
   $ ./cyber-dojo up katas=/var/www/cyber-dojo/katas
   Your new cyber-dojo server will have the same set of languages as the old one.
   If you want to remove or add languages see below.



   To list the installed languages, type
   $ ./cyber-dojo ls
   EXAMPLE OUTPUT

   To list available languages, type
   $ ./cyber-dojo ls_repo
   EXAMPLE OUTPUT

   To add a new language, type
   $ ./cyber-dojo pull IMAGE
   EXAMPLE OUTPUT
   and restart your server
   $ ./cyber-dojo up           <<<<< TODO CHECK THIS WORKS NOW I'M USING -d option


   To remove an existing language, type
   $ ./cyber-dojo rm IMAGE
   EXAMPLE OUTPUT
   and restart your server
   $ ./cyber-dojo up           <<<<< TODO CHECK THIS WORKS NOW I'M USING -d option
