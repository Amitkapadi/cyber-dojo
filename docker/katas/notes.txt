# docker-compose.yml entry looks like this...
# I don't specify the katas service in the yml
# If I do that the katas service goes down when I do
# $ docker-compose rm
#
#web
#  ...
#  volumes_from:
#    - cyber-dojo-katas
#

Should I change the cdf/cyber-dojo commands
Currently
  echo '    up [OPTIONS]      Brings up cyber-dojo server'
  echo '    down              Brings down cyber-dojo server'

Where up does
  up = dc-create +  dc-start (same as dc)
  down = dc-stop + dc-rm


Perhaps [create] should be done by install and not offered as option.
No rm offered either

  echo '    start [OPTIONS]      Starts cyber-dojo server'
  echo '    stop                 Stops cyber-dojo server'
