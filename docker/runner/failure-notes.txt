I tried moving the creation of the docker binary inside the image
and the sudo to give cyber-dojo user rights to run docker image
into a dedicated 'runner' Dockerfile.
I could not create an image/data-container
VOLUME /usr/bin/docker
failed with a message

Step 5 : VOLUME /usr/bin/docker
cannot mount volume over existing file, file exists /mnt/sda1/var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt/07b23cd124c7872f30d3e219aa665b1b89e7d4a019febd1a906b3294b0efdaa8/usr/bin/docker

Same thing happened for
VOLUME /etc/sudoers.d/cyber-dojo


This is a shame since they are logically separate.
