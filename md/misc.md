notes
-----
  * https://vimeo.com/104548135 has a video of me doing the Roman Numerals
   exercise in Ruby in cyber-dojo
  * When I started cyber-dojo I didn't know any ruby, any rails, or any
   javascript (and not much css or html either). I'm self-employed so
   I've have no-one to pair with (except google) while developing this
   in my limited spare time. Some of what you find is likely to be
   non-idiomatic. Caveat emptor!
