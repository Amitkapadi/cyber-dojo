running a programming dojo
==========================

creating your programming dojo
------------------------------
  * click the `[create]` button
  * click your chosen (language,unit-test-framework) combination, eg `C++,GoogleTest`
  * click your chosen exercise, eg `Prime Factors`
  * click the `[ok]` button
  * you'll get a case-insensitive 6-character hex-id. The full id is ten
    characters long (in the URL) but 6 is enough for uniqueness.


entering your programming dojo
------------------------------
  * on *each* participating computer...
  * enter the dojo's 6-character id into the green input box
  * click the `[enter]` button
  * a dialog will appear telling you which animal you are (eg Panda).
  * click `[ok]` to dismiss the dialog
  * a new test page/tab will open in your browser
  * edit the test files...
  * edit the code files...
  * press the `[test]` button
  * a new traffic-light appears at the top, left-to-right, oldest-to-newest
    indicating the result of the test (see below).
  * you can click on any traffic-light to open a diff/revert/fork history dialog.
    The history dialog shows the diffs between any two traffic-lights
    and has << < > >> buttons to navigate backwards and forwards.
    The dialog also has a `[revert]` button to revert back
    to the files from any traffic-light.
    The dialog also has a `[fork]` button to fork a new
    programming dojo with a new ID from that traffic light's files.

You can also re-enter at any animals' most recent traffic-light by pressing
the `[re-enter]` button (from the home page) and then clicking the animal.
This is occasionally useful if one computer has to replace another (eg
if your doing an evening dojo and someone has to leave early).
