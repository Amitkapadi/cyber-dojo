It seems reasonable for digital-ocean nodes to not necessarily all have
the same set of docker-containers installed.
So I'm thinking not to use docker-swarm.
Instead cache the docker-containers per IP address.
And select a digital-ocean node at random.

Also, why issue the rsync command from *inside* the
docker container. Why not instead
o) ssh in
o) rsync from the front-page-server to get katas sub-folder
o) docker-run with volume-mount for katas and have no network!

Consider too the option of rsync'ing *back* to the main-server.

If I do this I think I will gain the benefits of incremental
makefiles (for example) whilst at the same time only putting
text files in the katas/ git repos.
