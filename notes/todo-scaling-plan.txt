Brief notes from meeting with Jan and Mike 30th July 2015

Step 1: Test works 
Incoming files (for specific animal in specific dojo) are saved 
(can be into a temp folder, but )
A local git-commit happens.
The local git-repo is pushed to a central cyber-dojo git-server 
into a git-repo specific to the dojo and the animal. 
Initially this git-server can be on the same machine as the rails server.
Then we issue the magic incantation to spin up a docker process container.
The command this docker process runs will not volume mount anything. It will somehow

i) git-clone the files from the cyber-dojo git-server into a new local git repo (in a temp folder)
ii) build and test (cyber-dojo.sh)
iii) save output file 
iv) git-commit and git-tag
v) git-push to the cyber-dojo-git-server

Note that currently the docker process run command only has to do ii).


Step 2. Dashboard works in new design.

Step 3. Sym-linking is abandoned for all newly created cyber-dojos.

Step 4. Swarm on multiple nodes

Step 5. Add docker data-containers.
Means the git-clone in step i) above can change to a git-pull.


Still to be considered...
o) Forking
o) Reverting

o) Old cyber-dojos (not on the cyber-dojo-git-server) still work as before...?
