LINE-NUMBERS
  There is some combination of line-numbers on/off
  and creating a new file that still seems to not
  be quite right. Viz you can get all files with
  line-numbers except one. Cannot reproduce it.

  katas/34/87780530/hippo/sandbox
  this has a cyber-dojo.sh file with the line
     echo 'Hello' > jj.txt
  delete jj.txt on browser
  hit [test]
  it is not being gm rm'd on the server
  I think the problem here is that the generated .txt file is
  sent back to the browser but it is not git added to the sandbox.
  And similarly approval .txt files that are deleted are also
  not git rm'd.
  Ponder this...
  How about this...
  o) avatar.save()   does disk file commands but *not* git commands
  o) avatar.test()
  o) output is saved to disk
  o) now newly created .txt files are added to visible_files
     and 'add' info is added to object holding git info
  o) now deleted .txt files are removed from visible_files
     and 'rm' info is added to object holding git into
  o) avatar.save(visible_files)
  o) parse output
  o) avatar.save(traffic_lights)
  o) now all accumulated git commands are executed
  o) not git commit and git tag commands are executed

FAULT
  If you create a new nested-filenamed (containing 1+ backslash)
  it is saved correctly in the sandbox but not retained in the
  git repo - do a refresh in the browser and you lose the file.

FAULT
  You should be able to enter nested filenames in a
  languages manifest.json

FAULT
  When Approval txt file is auto opened after pressing [test]
  it does not honour the line-numbers state.

FAULT
  line-numbers appear momentarily when you press [revert]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
FAULT
  When you're in a diff-page and the file has multiple red/green sections
  then clicking on the filename should auto-scroll to the next red/green
  section. It doesn't. Or rather, it seems inconsistent.

FAULT
  If you specify ?locale=fr at the end of the dashboard URL
  it changes the animals names but then resets to english
  when the auto-refresh happens.
