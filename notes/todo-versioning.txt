An cyberdojo's manifest.json file contains the name of the language. Eg
  cyber-dojo/katas/A9/606FDA05/manifest.json
    { ....  "language":"Java-1.8_JUnit" .... }
  cyber-dojo/katas/3F/611E5054/manifest.json
    { ....  "language":"C++-GoogleTest" .... }

Note this is the name and not the display_name.

This often contains the version number.
This is a mistake. It makes it harder than necessary
to update a container (eg Ruby 1.9.3 to 2.1.3)

It is much better to create a base language container
image which includes its version in its name.
Eg

Ruby-1.9.3
  build-docker-container.sh  --> cyberdojo/ruby-1.9.3
  Dockerfile
Ruby-2.1.3
  build-docker-container.sh  --> cyberdojo/ruby-2.1.3
  Dockerfile

And then to create language+unit-test
based on a language with a specific version and whose
docker container name itself *does* contain a
version number.

Ruby-MiniTest
  build-docker-container.sh  --> cyberdojo/ruby-2.1.3_mini_test
  Dockerfile (FROM cyberdojo/ruby-2.1.3)


Moving forward I am going to have to create
a 'rename' adapter for the language which bypasses
this for existing dojos.
