DIFF-DIALOG
  show the _time_ between two tags
  [23] 00:54 [24]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
KATAS-FOLDER
  would be nice to be able to set ENV variables for
  the root-paths for each of these 3 independently
    o) languages/
    o) exercises/
    o) katas/

DOWNLOAD
  reinstate download button on dashboard page.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DASHBOARD-TIME-GAP
  if there is a session that is split over several hours, eg
  if you resume a session one morning after starting it the
  previous session, it might be nice to be able to view
  one dashboard in two parts.

DIFF-DIALOG
  o) click on the animal to open a re-enter like 'dialog'
     which you can click on to move to diff 0-1 of next animal.
  o) have [next animal] button
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-DIALOG
  have [revert] button on now-tag control
  have [fork] button on now-tag control
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-DIALOG
  with the above features it is questionable whether to leave
  the diff-dialog as a dialog. If it was a regular page it would
  offer more consistency and also the goggle diagnostics would
  be able to give me better review stats.

KATA-EXPIRED
  have a timeout (1 day)
  when katas has expired
    o) no [revert]
    o) no [test]
  How? There is no heartbeat.

READ-ONLY SERVER
  o) need kata-expired
  o) needs GitRunner that is read-only
       no init,add,rm   [diff,show]

AVATAR
  write run_tests(...) function that wraps all of this...
     save(delta, visible_files)
     output = test(max_duration)
     save_visible_files(...)
     save_traffic_lights(...)
  which currently happens in kata_controller
  It can parse output to determine traffic_light colour
  Might be able to reduce number of @variables in some controllers
  so the views reach into the domain objects...

SETUP-PAGE
  this can show a pre-allocated ID !
  ties it back to the home page nicely.
  [create] can go with the id
  [cancel] can be separated off to the right
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DASHBOARD-FIRST-TRAFFIC-LIGHT
  in a refactoring dojo you want all the animals to be visible
  right from the start. They start from green. Perhaps show
  initial traffic-light only if its green?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DASHBOARD-DURATION
  the duration currently shows the time from the moment the
  dojo was created to the current moment. This could do with
  tweaking.
  Firstly, suppose you create a special setup (via forking)
  hours before it is needed. The duration time should start
  when the first animal presses [test].
  Also the duration end time should be calculated from the
  current time only if there has been a traffic-light
  within the last N minutes. If there hasn't, the duration end
  time should be the time of the last traffic light.
  This could be a good requirement to refactor the domain
  to include traffic-lights.

META-DASHBOARD
  have a page that allows you to enter the IDs of several dojos
  and these then look like filenames on the lhs. Clicking on
  one of them opens the dashboard for that id. This allows you
  to create a summary dashboard for codeRetreat style days.

HELP
  need to add some text somewhere about to use fork to setup
  a specific starting position.

INITIALLY-RED-TESTS
  do this by using fail("") calls rather than deliberately wrong values.
  do this for all languages.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-REVERT-FORK DIALOG
  filenames do not appear in same way as on edit page.
  eg makefile and cyber-dojo.sh are not lo-lighted
  and are listed in different order.

LINE-NUMBERS

  Get linenumber from cursor?

DIFF-DIALOG
  reclicking the filename to scroll to the next diff-chunk
  does not work (sometimes) for the 2nd+ clicks. Look at
    http://manos.malihu.gr/page-scroll-to-id/

HOME-PAGE
  the small buttons on rhs no longer have the hover ghosting
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DOCKER
  It would be a good idea if the setup screen/dialog
  indicated which Runner was being used, Docker or Raw.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
FILENAMES
  if there are lots of filenames make the scrollbar
  omit scrolling the output file.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
EXERCISE=NONE
  add exercise called none
  which has empty instructions file.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
UNTAR
  o) untar all files in downloads/ and zips/
  o) Do this off to the size of the main katas/ folder
     so that I avoid checking katas I've already checked.
  o) admin_scripts/find_old_language_names.rb will need refactoring
     so cyber-dojo-root-dir is a parameter.
  o) run admin_scripts/find_old_language_names.rb
  o) use info it generates to patch more language names.
  o) see if any katas are corrupt and are not worth saving.

C/C++ MAKEFILES
  improve them.
  ask for input from accu-general
  requirements
    - makes lib from non test src files
    - makes test exe from test src and lib
    - runs test exe
    - knows if makefile is changed

TOOL-TIPS
  have them open up in a popup right next to the item they are tipping.
  Look at how its done in jQuery book?
  Find plug-in.

MODEL
  in app/lib/LinuxPaas.rb
  def make_kata_manifest(dojo, language, exercise, id, now)
    {
      :created => now,
      :id => id,
      :language => language.name,
      :exercise => exercise.name,
      :unit_test_framework => language.unit_test_framework,
      :tab_size => language.tab_size
    }
  end
  Do I need to put :unit_test_framework and :tab_size
  into the kata's manifest? Why not retrieve them
  from the language? Is there a dependency on the
  language name? What if I rename a language?

EXERCISE-HAS-MANIFEST
  At the moment the instructions come from exercises/ and
  everything else comes from languages/ via manifest.rb
  This means if I want to create a special exercise with
  :highlight_filenames I have to do it as an exercise.
  And then I have to know to select it only with a specific language.
  How about allowing a language folder to have its own exercise folders.
  And give Exercise a manifest like Language?
