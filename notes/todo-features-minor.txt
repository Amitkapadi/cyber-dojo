DOCKER
  It would be a good idea if the setup screen/dialog
  indicated which Runner was being used, Docker or Raw.

ADMIN-SCRIPTS
  docker_pull_all.rb
  contains duplication. Better to iterate through the languages/
  and extract the image_name entries from the manifest.json files.

LANGUAGE-CHECKER
  test/installation red/amber/green testing need TLC

TOOL-TIPS
  have them open up in popup right next to the item they are tipping.
  Look at how its done in jQuery book.

DOCKER IMAGE NAMES
  put version-number on all container names
  give each language its own docker image even if its simply a tag
   on an existing one. eg clojure
  Clojure --> 1.4.0   (from jar file) (currently java-1.8)

MODEL
  in app/lib/LinuxPaas.rb
  def make_kata_manifest(dojo, language, exercise, id, now)
    {
      :created => now,
      :id => id,
      :language => language.name,
      :exercise => exercise.name,
      :unit_test_framework => language.unit_test_framework,
      :tab_size => language.tab_size
    }
  end
  Do I need to put :unit_test_framework and :tab_size
  into the kata's manifest? Why not retrieve them
  from the language? Is there a dependency on the
  language name? What if I rename a language?

FORKER-CONTROLLER
  for .html format I'm not checking if the fork worked.

test/app_models
  drop linux_paas_ prefix from all test files that stub.
  Make commented out tests in test/app_model/avatar_tests.rb live

OUTPUT-PARSER
  in app/lib/
  Refactor so patterns are matched for red and green
  and default after those two is amber.
  Use /regexp/ syntax.

MODEL
  in Language.rb patch remaining names so it converts old-names to new-names
  Delete few Objective-C katas on cyber-dojo.org ?
  Create docker image for Objective-C ?

CSS
  use cursor: not-allowed
  for disabled buttons.
  Do on jQuery dialog buttons too.

LANGUAGE MANIFEST.JSON

EXERCISE-HAS-MANIFEST
  At the moment the instructions come from exercises/ and
  everything else comes from languages/ via manifest.rb
  This means if I want to create a special exercise with
  :highlight_filenames I have to do it as an exercise.
  And then I have to know to select it only with a specific language.
  How about allowing a language folder to have its own exercise folders.
  And give Exercise a manifest like Language?

CUSTOM-DOMAIN-NAMES
  James spins up custom names for clients
  eg  cisco.cyber-dojo.org - from amazon route 53
  Nice idea.
