TEST-PAGE
  help dialog top panel is slightly wider than panels below
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
INSTALLATION-TESTS
  Create script that can pass root_dir and optional language to remainder
    it will check languages off the root_dir
    if language supplied will check only that
  Install cpputest and get app/lib coverage to 100%
  Save run-tests outputs to log file?

  show the content with the red/green deleted/added lines

drop diff-review button on [test] page
Rely on always pressing a traffic-light to get diff-dialog.
drop dashboard button too? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
REVERT
  Hashes of the files, together with filenames, could be used
  to determine if a traffic-light is reverted.
  ...
  Store the hashes in increments.rb ?
  Yes. Do this as part of .rb -> .json file refactoring towards
  read-only server

DIFF-DIALOG
  Add its own tool-tips
  ...
  if you press < > and the next diff has no actual diff
  then repeat (automatically) the < > until you get an actual diff?

DASHBOARD
  Rename zips folder to downloads folder
  Figure out how to have download tests and gz file is rm'd on server
  Install download button
  Later I can add a publish button which exports the dojo to cyber-katas.org
  Dashboard on read-only server won't need heartbeat
  Dashboard on read-only server won't need age (use creation date instead)
  ...
  Dont refresh dashboard when refresh goes from on->off?
  ...
  Maybe show ticks on top row to indicate where columns are
  Or perhaps try subtle alternate "vertical-stripe" shading on rows.
  ...
  Nicer help dialog content (same format as on test page)

I18N  
  Need to be i18n'd on the setup page.
  ...
  On dialog buttons
    cancel: new-file,rename-file,delete-file
    close: diff-review, revert, fork
    fork: fork
    revert: revert
  ...  
  Lots more.
  Have promises for Russian and Ukranian.

TEST-PAGE
  filenames: add * marker if files have changed since last [test] ?
  ...
  If [test] pressed and nothing has changed since last traffic-light
  pop up a dialog? Saying nothing different since last time.
  ...
  Should clicking avatar image on [test] page open dashboard? or home?

  Use a dialog?

HOME
  Perhaps disable resume/review buttons until dojo is 30 seconds old?

REFACTORING
  Revert and fork javascript is virtually identical.
  ...
  Can i18n yml files be split?
  ...
  Exception_controller_test.rb needs some assertions!
  ...
  Rename css files,
    eg forker->forker_dialog
    eg reverter->reverter_dialog
    eg diff->diff_dialog
    don't forget to update application.css.scss

  it does not honour the line-numbers state.

READONLY PRACTICE VIEW WITH VOTING
  Start to think about opening up the done katas so people
  can see them and vote on them.

ANIMATION
  keeping on the same file and showing its content in a rapid

LINE-NUMBERS
  Dynamically change width from <99 to 100+
  Make the left padding on the line-numbers (on test page)
  a bit thinner. Only if its >99 lines long use extra padding.

FORWARDS-BACKWARDS

  What do I bind to?
  Or did James mean to cycle through edited files in the test page?

feedback from Derek Graham.
o) devs seem very reluctant to change the names of the untitled. files
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
At the moment the instructions come from exercises/ and
everything else comes from languages/ via manifest.rb
This means if I want to create a special exercise with
:highlight_filenames I have to do it as an exercise :-}

------------------------------------------------------------
It would be simpler if output and instructions were not mixed
into kata.language and avatar.setup did an explicit
save(kata.exercise.instructions)

app/helpers
  not enough coverage on
    translation_helper.rb
    application_helper.rb
  
app/controllers
  application_controller.set_locale
  locales_controller.change

Thinking about how I could reduce the number of clicks to get started...
Suppose there were 4 rooms, each of a different colour.
Then players would not need to type in an ID. The room could have an ID
which they could use to get back to the session at a later time.
But at the start one person configures the blue room and then all the
players have to do is press the start button in the blue room.
Then they get a dialog saying "You are the panda". And you have to click
the ok button. Could I get rid of even that? Instead of a start button you
could have 16 animal buttons and you have to choose your animal by clicking it.
This also opens up the potential for not doing a setup, and then if you click
an animal, you get a random language+exercise combination.
The downside of this, of course, is that the blue room could be full when you
want to join it. But the upside is tremendous. You can see what people are
doing all the time without needing an ID.
I think this approach would definitely need each room to have a time-limit.
That way the room would become free again some time later.
Would mean the room-session could also have a name.
How about allowing a session to be either public or private.
If it's public then you can click a refresh button in your chosen room
(or ideally it appears all by itself) and a button for your session,
with its language,exercise,name,id is displayed. Click on it and you start.
This would also allow a history of previous sessions (by room perhaps).
Also, at the setup page, you could show all sessions that match the combination
you have chosen. And you could view those.
Or here's a possibly nice variation. Instead of public/private.
Have only public. But if you want you can delay (say by 1 hour) the public
appearance of the id.
Obviously a big design criteria for having private IDs is that it means
I don't really have to worry about 2+ computers using the same animal
at the same time. The resume feature means this is a definite possibility
if the ID is public.
