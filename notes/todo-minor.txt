FORK/REVERT.
  Now that all traffic-lights appear at bottom pressing
  traffic-light could bring up a dialog asking
  What you want to do with traffic-light 34
  o) view its diff
  o) revert to it
  o) fork a new dojo from it
  Don't like this design though. I'd prefer that pressing a
  traffic-light brings up a dialog with << < > >> movement
  and you can also revert/fork from the left/right traffic-light.
  Or, how about if the was_tag and the now_tag are the same then
  revert and fork buttons appear. YES. Like that. I think.
  Too clever? Looking at diff-view dialog and imagining how
  might look. Too clever I think.

HOME-PAGE
  would be nice if it had a heartbeat so it could detect and
  auto-enable the resume/review buttons.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
HOME-PAGE
  add a [publish] button. Perhaps layout as
  [ start] [ review]
  [resume] [publish]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-VIEW
  put line numbers back in. I find I quite often look at the
  output and it names a file and a line-number and I want to
  look at that line-number.
  Ideally, line-numbes are toggleable on/off.

DEFECT
  Refactoring page on blog no longer works because
  forker/fork is now an ajax call returning json.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
REVERT
  line-numbers appear momentarily

  o) create External object holding disk,git,task
  o) External has .dojo(dir)
       which passes disk,git,task to Dojo.ctor
  o) Dojo has [id]
       which passes disk,git,task to Kata.ctor
  o) Kata has .create_avatar
       which passes disk,git,task to Avatar.ctor
  Problem with this is controller_tests. Eg before this
      get 'dojo/start_json', {
        :format => :json,
        :id => id
      }
    how can I control what externals are set in application_controller?
    With Thread[:disk] I can intercept...

19th Feb 2014: On cyber-dojo.com ran
  > ruby prune_small.rb true 3 7
    2764 katas deleted
    5783 katas not deleted
  >df
  reports no inodes regained?
  Wrong partition!
  Fixed etc/fstab so instead of
      /mnt/katas /var/www/cyberdojo/katas
      it does
      /mnt/cyberdojo /var/www/cyberdojo
  which transfers about 7G from the 10G-fs to the 100G-fs :-)
  that is much better.
  ...
  Copied tar.gz files back from cyber-katas to cyber-dojo.com
  Now untarring them on cyber-dojo.com
    find . -name '*.tar.gz' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 tar xf
  Getting some errors...
    gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
    tar: Child returned status 1

  Need to find out which ids are causing failures and why.
  Moved them back to separate downloads folder.

  The xfer.rb script could take the URL as a parameter.
  Will probably want to xfer in both directions.

DIFF-DIALOG
  make content area slightly wider and deeper to match fork/revert
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
TOOL-TIP
   default state can be showing a message saying
   hover over any element to reveal its tooltip?

INSTALLATION-TESTS
  Install cpputest and get app/lib coverage to 100%
  Save run-tests outputs to log file?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
FORK-REVERT
  make it look the same as diff-dialog
    show the filenames with red/green line-counts
    show the content with the red/green deleted/added lines
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
REVERT
  Hashes of the files, together with filenames, could be used
  to determine if a traffic-light is reverted.

  Store the hashes in increments.rb ?
  Yes. Do this as part of .rb -> .json file refactoring towards
  read-only server

DASHBOARD
  Rename zips folder to downloads folder
  Figure out how to have download tests and gz file is rm'd on server
  Install download button
  Later I can add a publish button which exports the dojo to cyber-katas.org
  Dashboard on read-only server won't need heartbeat
  Dashboard on read-only server won't need age (use creation date instead)
  ...
  Dont refresh dashboard when refresh goes from on->off?
  ...
  Maybe show ticks on top row to indicate where columns are
  Or perhaps try subtle alternate "vertical-stripe" shading on rows.
  ...
  Nicer help dialog content (same format as on test page)

  If [test] pressed and nothing has changed since last traffic-light
  pop up a dialog? Saying nothing different since last time.

REFACTORING
  Revert and fork javascript is virtually identical.

  Can i18n yml files be split?

  Exception_controller_test.rb needs some assertions!

  Rename css files,
    eg forker->forker_dialog

READONLY PRACTICE VIEW WITH VOTING
  Start to think about opening up the done katas so people
  can see them and vote on them.

ANIMATION
  keeping on the same file and showing its content in a rapid
  sequence of updates would be a nice feature?
  Do on dialog not showing diffs.
  Reduce font a lot so you can see outline. Auto? Slider-control?
  Stay on same file.
  Would be even better if it could detect a rename.

feedback from Derek Graham.
o) devs seem very reluctant to change the names of the untitled. files
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
At the moment the instructions come from exercises/ and
everything else comes from languages/ via manifest.rb
This means if I want to create a special exercise with
:highlight_filenames I have to do it as an exercise :-}
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -




------------------------------------------------------------
It would be simpler if output and instructions were not mixed
into kata.language and avatar.setup did an explicit
save(kata.exercise.instructions)

app/helpers
  not enough coverage on
    translation_helper.rb
    application_helper.rb

app/controllers
  application_controller.set_locale
  locales_controller.change

-------------------------------------------------------------
Thinking about how I could reduce the number of clicks to get started...
Suppose there were 4 rooms, each of a different colour.
Then players would not need to type in an ID. The room could have an ID
which they could use to get back to the session at a later time.
But at the start one person configures the blue room and then all the
players have to do is press the start button in the blue room.
Then they get a dialog saying "You are the panda". And you have to click
the ok button. Could I get rid of even that? Instead of a start button you
could have 16 animal buttons and you have to choose your animal by clicking it.
This also opens up the potential for not doing a setup, and then if you click
an animal, you get a random language+exercise combination.
The downside of this, of course, is that the blue room could be full when you
want to join it. But the upside is tremendous. You can see what people are
doing all the time without needing an ID.
I think this approach would definitely need each room to have a time-limit.
That way the room would become free again some time later.
Would mean the room-session could also have a name.
How about allowing a session to be either public or private.
If it's public then you can click a refresh button in your chosen room
(or ideally it appears all by itself) and a button for your session,
with its language,exercise,name,id is displayed. Click on it and you start.
This would also allow a history of previous sessions (by room perhaps).
Also, at the setup page, you could show all sessions that match the combination
you have chosen. And you could view those.
Or here's a possibly nice variation. Instead of public/private.
Have only public. But if you want you can delay (say by 1 hour) the public
appearance of the id.
Obviously a big design criteria for having private IDs is that it means
I don't really have to worry about 2+ computers using the same animal
at the same time. The resume feature means this is a definite possibility
if the ID is public.
