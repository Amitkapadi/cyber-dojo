Limiting to 2 hours or 1 day or whatever is not so good.
It restricts use at Universities for example.
Rather than measuring time from the start of the dojo
how about measuring the time from the last test-event.
If there has been no activity for 28 days (say) then
the dojo is automatically 'finished' and becomes readonly.
Also have [finished] button which also makes the dojo readonly.  

Being able to finish dojos is a key feature.
It means I don't have to worry about resuming old dojos.
I only need to make sure forking works.
This in turn means I can put support files inside the
docker containers.

This could also improve the dashboard display of the age of the
dojo. Instead of displaying the time since the start of the
dojo (to now) I could instead display the time from the start
of the dojo to the last traffic-light.
This means that a dojo that took 2 hours (for example) would
display as 2 hours and not as 4 days, 5 days, 6 days...
as each day passes.

I could show 
o) the start date/time of a dojo.
o) its duration (start time to last test event).
o) whether it has finished.
o) how long it's been since last test event (if it's not finished).

Makes sense to implement this once katas automatically becoming
readonly (if they have finished) is implemented.

Might also make sense to allow the creation of a dojo to
specify its maximum duration. And don't allow a maximum
duration over 28 days (say), with a default of 1 day.

Also needs all date/times to come from the browser and not
the server.
