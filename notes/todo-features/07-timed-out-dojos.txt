Limiting to 2 hours or 1 day or whatever is not so good.
It restricts use at Universities for example.
Rather than measuring time from the start of the dojo
how about measuring the time from the last test-event.
If there has been no activity for 28 days (say) then
the dojo is automatically 'finished' and becomes readonly.
Also have [finished] button which also makes the dojo readonly.
