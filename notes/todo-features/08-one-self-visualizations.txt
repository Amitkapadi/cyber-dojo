'diff-added' =>
'diff-deleted' =>
'seconds-since-last-traffic-light' => ...

Idea is to visualize 3 simple histograms
Each test event creates a bar. Bar is coloured
red/amber/green to match its test outcome.
Height of bar is value of 
1. diff-added (1st histogram)
2. diff-deleted (2nd histogram)
3. seconds-since-last-traffic-light (3rd histogram)
