'diff-added' =>
'diff-deleted' =>
'seconds-since-last-traffic-light' => ...

Idea is to visualize 3 simple histograms
Each test event creates a bar. Bar is coloured
red/amber/green to match its test outcome.
Height of bar is value of 
1. diff-added (1st histogram)
2. diff-deleted (2nd histogram)
3. seconds-since-last-traffic-light (3rd histogram)

OneSelf.rb
how to get seconds since last 'event'
tag==1 is the first test event
so if Tag.rb had time in the same way Light.rb has I could
s_new = avatar.tags[tag].time
s_old = avatar.tags[tag-1].time
(s_new - s_old)
