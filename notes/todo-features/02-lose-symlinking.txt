sym-linking...

Renaming/restructuring the language folders.
One effect of this will be that existing
dojos for languages that have sym-linked 
support files will no longer be resumable.
Or rather, they will be re-enterable, and
you will be able to fork, but you will 
not be able to [test]
This suggests that dojos should have a
max duration. Say one day.
See 07-timed-out-dojos.txt

Maybe work to rework languages that have sym-links
so their symlinked files are inside the docker 
container, and then remove sym-linking completely.

This will update the docker container images.
They will have the same name of course.
This means I will need to check for updates.
$ docker pull NAME
does nothing quite fast if there is no change.
But pulls the new image if it has changed.

So I need to create a script to iterate through
the installed languages and check for updates
by (re)pulling their docker containers.
And then add that to pull.sh
