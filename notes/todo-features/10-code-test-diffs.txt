The diff dialog shows files with their diff counts

   2 4  Wibble.java
   1 5  WibbleTest.java
   
how about differentiating between diffs to the code and diffs to the tests.
This could allow a histogram like graph where changes to code are shown
as histograms below zero, and changes to the tests are shown as
changes to the code above zero. And time on the x axis.

This would allow a visualization of whether test first is being
practiced. It would allow you to see times when code and tests
are being edited at the same time.

Of course I can already see this since I have a diff count for
each file. But the code and test files are listed in the same
file knave. Perhaps list the code and tests in two knaves?
Maybe have three knaves and put the helper files in the
third one (cyber-dojo.sh makefile).
instructions would go in the test knave.
where would the output go? 
in none of them I think.
the output file is the one that closes the feedback loop.
maybe rename output to feedback!?

new/rename/delete
When I made a new file I might have to specify
which knave it was to go in.
Rename too.
Delete would be ok.

At the least output could go in its own knave
both in the diff dialog and the test page.

Should makefile be non-deletable/renamable?
