o) make a ramdisk and use that for *all* tests.
  ramdisk = '/mnt/ramdisk'
  `umount #{ramdisk}`
  `rm -rf #{ramdisk}`
  `mkdir #{ramdisk}`
  `mount -t tmpfs -o size=1m tmpfs #{ramdisk}`
  `mkdir #{ramdisk}/katas`

o) export CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_ROOT=/mnt/katas
   rework tests

o) delete test code that is now redundant

o) assuming git running on /mnt/ramdisk/katas is fast enough
   there would appear to be scope to refactor the git class
   so it is passed the folder it is associated with in initialize()
   Then drop path argument from all git methods.

o) cache the result of
   $docker images
   in the ramdisk to speed up the opening page.
   /mnt/ramdisk/languages/docker_images.cache
   chown www-data:www-data it too
   Do this as part of admin_scripts/pull.sh

o) app/models/external_parent_chain.rb
   move module_function to top so all a private inside included class.
   If any test does, eg, kata.dir I can instead do disk[kata.path]

o) test/app_lib has lots of assertions. Check it.

o) in setup_controller.rb
   maybe...
    language = dojo.languages[params['language'] + '-' + params['test']]
   ...becomes...
    language = dojo.languages[params['language'], params['test']]
