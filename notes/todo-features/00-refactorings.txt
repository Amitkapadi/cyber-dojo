o) use ramdisk for *all* tests.
   lib first
   app_controllers second
   export CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_ROOT=/mnt/katas
   rework tests so CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_ROOT must be set or it is an error.
   Some tests such as hostdisk tests can always use the ramdisk.

o) delete test code that is now redundant

o) rework exercises/ and languages/ caches.
   See comment about not using obvious code
   because some code uses DiskFake

o) app/models/external_parent_chain.rb
   move module_function to top so all a private inside included class.
   If any test does, eg, kata.dir I can instead do disk[kata.path]

o) assuming git running on /mnt/ramdisk/katas is fast enough
   there would appear to be scope to refactor the git class
   so it is passed the folder it is associated with in initialize()
   Then drop path argument from all git methods.

o) cache the result of
   `docker images`
   in the ramdisk to speed up the opening page?
   /mnt/ramdisk/languages/docker_images.cache
   chown www-data:www-data it too
   Do this as part of admin_scripts/pull.sh
   Does this mean RUNNER should have its own env var ROOT?

o) test/app_lib has lots of assertions. Check it.

o) in setup_controller.rb
   maybe...
    language = dojo.languages[params['language'] + '-' + params['test']]
   ...becomes...
    language = dojo.languages[params['language'], params['test']]
