o) names of folders are now decoupled
   s/g++4.8.4/C++ (g++4.8.4)/
   s/g++4.9/C++ (g++4.9)/

o) move avatar.diff() into module app_lib/git_diff.rb

o) move language - cyber-dojo update code into dedicated class/module

o) forker_controller now does not do
     !kata.language.exists?
   instead does
     kat.language.nil?
   can language.exists? be dropped?
   can all .exists? be dropped?

o) languages[] idea
     cache[display_name] || cache[renamed(display_name)]

o) note duplication now in
   test/app_controller/AppControllerTestBase.rb and
   test/app_models/AppModelTestBase.rb and
   test/app_helpers/AppHelpersTestBase.rb
   test/lib/LibTestBase.rb and

o) cache the result of
   `docker images`
   in the ram_disk cache to speed up the opening page?
   /mnt/ram_disk/languages/docker_images.cache
   chown www-data:www-data it too
   Do this as part of admin_scripts/pull.sh
   Does this mean RUNNER should have its own env var ROOT?

o) use ramdisk for *all* tests.
   rework tests so CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_ROOT must be set or it is an error?

o) delete test code that is now redundant?

o) test/languages
     ./check_one_language.rb ok
     ./all_languages_test.rb fails on 'C (gcc)' CppUTest gives
        Error response from daemon: no such id: cat:
        Error response from daemon: no such id: No
        Error response from daemon: no such id: such
        Error response from daemon: no such id: file
        Error response from daemon: no such id: or
        Error response from daemon: no such id: directory
     get the same failure from
     sudo -E -u www-data ./check_one_language.rb 'C (gcc)' CppUTest verbose
     This appears to be because it does not check if the docker-image is installed.

o) languages [] idea
   def [](language_name, test_name)
     ...
   end
   If I use this [,] careful about forking. Comes to kata.language
   which does this
   dojo.languages[manifest_property]
   language property of kata manifest is language.name
   which does this
     display_name.split(',').map(&:strip).join('-')

o) reinstate app_controllers/download tests
   should be fast now I'm using ram_disk

o) create a new caches folder to go with exercises/ languages/ and katas/
   this will hold exercises.cache languages.cache and
   docker_images.cache
   location set via CYBER_DOJO_CACHES_ROOT
   point this to small ramdisk.

o) app/models/external_parent_chain.rb
   move module_function to top so all methods are private inside included class?
   If any test does, eg, kata.dir I can instead do disk[kata.path]

o) test/lib/DirFake.rb
   has [make] call in write(filename, s) that does not match
   write(filename, s) in HostDir.rb

o) assuming git running on /mnt/ramdisk/katas is fast enough
   there would appear to be scope to refactor the git class
   so it is passed the folder it is associated with in initialize()
   Then drop path argument from all git methods.
