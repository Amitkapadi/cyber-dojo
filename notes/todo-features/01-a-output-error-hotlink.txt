OUTPUT-HOTLINK (7)
    hot key (ALT-E perhaps) causes...
    javascript to matches the output for *first*
      file+line-number in error message (in pattern of output)
    auto opens that file
    scrolls to the line-number.

If there is no error (green) then the pattern should not match.
But maybe it could work for both red and amber?
Require only that there is an error in the output file.
The pattern matches or it doesn't.
Don't need to have the output file open.


Sometimes the error message will be for a non-visible file.
Eg C++ templates pointing you to a std library file
that you are misusing. Suggests that the algorithm to
find the error should be to pattern match for all
filename:line-number: (or whatever the pattern is)
and then process those looking for the first filename
that is one of the visible filenames.

Suppose you are doing C++ and you wanted to tinker with
the makefile? In that case you could get an error
with a different pattern from make.
This suggests the option of having a *sequence* of
patterns, which are processed one at a time, as
described above, till a match is made to a visible
file.
