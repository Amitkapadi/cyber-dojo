Split create page's two columns into three columns.
language? tests? exercise?

When language with only one test framework is selected
then the tests? column has only that entry.

How to code the tests? column?
One way would be to mirror the way files are done on the test page.
Viz, each tests column has pre-created html and when you select
a language the tests column for the current language is hidden
and the tests column for the selected language is displayed.

Only real requirement is that initial display defaults to
same language,tests,exercise selection as the previous dojo's
ID (if there was a previous dojo).
