Idea from James.
On dashboard, hovering over a traffic light makes the js
to go to the server to retrieve information for the diff
to that traffic-light.
  o) number of files changed
  o) total number of lines added
  o) total number of lines deleted
  o) difference between the number of lines added and removed.

Tool-tip can now include any html.
I could embed an image of the animal instead of using the
word. I could put a mini image of each traffic-light
for the diff-tip content.

I could add a tooltips to the traffic-lights on the
history diff dialog too.

How to detect which lines have been changed?
git diff has a cool --word-diff option
$ git diff --word-diff 13 14
Gives [-DEL-]{+ADD+} for changes *inside* a line (there can be several)
Eg...
Note too there is an option for using a regex to decide what's a word
 --word-diff-regex=<regex>

Note that 'words' are separated by whitespace.
How could I rediff the [--]{++} strings above to get the
minimal diff, which in the above case is just a singel additional s.
One way would be to write the two strings to two files, putting
a newline after each character - and then do a regular diff
on the two files!
Can you do a diff on two strings?



added lines come out as
