Idea from James.
On dashboard, hovering over a traffic light makes the js
to go to the server to retrieve information for the diff
to that traffic-light.
  o) number of files changed
  o) total number of lines added
  o) total number of lines deleted
  o) difference between the number of lines added and removed.


How to detect which lines have been changed?
git diff has a cool --word-diff option
$ git diff --word-diff 13 14
Gives [-DEL-]{+ADD+} for changes *inside* a line (there can be several)
Eg...

diff --git a/sandbox/test_hiker.rb b/sandbox/test_hiker.rb
index 5f07ee8..424deac 100644
--- a/sandbox/test_hiker.rb
+++ b/sandbox/test_hiker.rb

  def test_life_the_universe_and_everything

end
