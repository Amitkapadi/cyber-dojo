Idea from James.
On dashboard, hovering over a traffic light makes the js
to go to the server to retrieve information for the diff
to that traffic-light.
  o) number of files changed
  o) total number of lines added
  o) total number of lines deleted
  o) difference between the number of lines added and removed.

Can I simply use jQuery hover() for this?
See example http://api.jquery.com/hover/
