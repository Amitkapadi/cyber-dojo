1. HOTKEY  (5)
  A) Alt-o hotkey cycles between most recently opened non-output file
     and the output file.
  Maximise depth of filenames list.
  Make output file a button? Interesting idea.
  How about output and cyber-dojo.sh are listed first and slightly
  separated from the main files. Hmmm. And by default you do
  not cycle through those two when you do forward/backward.
  Yes. And if there are a lot of filenames, output and cyber-dojo.sh
  never go out of view (so that output is always clickable) as if it
  was a button.

  B) Forward and Backward hot-key cycles through highlighted files
    (if there are any) and output?

  Can you name output (or instructions) as highlighted files in
  the manifest? I think not and it would be good if you could.

2. ROGUE-CHARACTERS-ON-INPUT (3)
  in Avatar.rb the output is encoded to strip rogue characters.
  Sometimes you get these rogue characters on input.
  So what I really need to do is to strip the rogue characters on INPUT!
  Shift-Alt-T will put a rogue character in to generate a test. Eg in a ruby file.
  One option is to filter the input on each character press in the browser.

  Note this will not handle pasted-in code.
  ...
  var isPrintable = function(e) {
      return e.which !== 0 &&
      e.charCode !== 0 &&
      !e.ctrlKey &&
      !e.metaKey &&
      !e.altKey
  }
  $("input").keypress(function (e) {
      if (!isPrintable(e)) {
          e.preventDefault();
      }
  });
  Also, to remove non-printable characters from string s on rails server
  s.gsub!(/[^[:print:]]/i, '')

3. OUTPUT-HOTLINK (7)
  if output file is selected
    hot key (ALT-E perhaps) causes...
    javascript to matches the output for *first*
      file+line-number in error message (in pattern of output)
    auto opens that file
    scrolls to the line-number.

4. SEARCH-REPLACE (15)
  button just below new/rename/delete
  opens dialog
  files?  defaults to current file, can enter regex if you want
  search: defaults to content selected in editor (or "")
  replace: defaults to content selected in editor (or "")
  and [button]
  SED ?
  As you enter the search pattern the filenames listed
  are dynamically enabled/disabled (checkboxes).
  And if you don't hit replace, then this gives you a way
  to search!
  Should the filenames displayed be all the files, or
  if highlighted files are marked, only the marked ones?
  Hmmmm. No, because the files the dev creates are bound to be
  the ones they want to search inside.
  Also, is output included in the filename list?
  Also, is cyber-dojo.sh included in the filename list?

5. EXTRA-INFO (20)
  on the animal display (eg on dashboard) show the number of passing
  tests (if at green). This is very useful for situations where (eg James)
  has an exercise where he has created all the tests and the task
  is to work through them.
