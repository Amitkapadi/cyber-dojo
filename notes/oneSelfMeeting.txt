when dojo is created I need to send 
language & test-framework names
to 1self

for each test event send the 
'dateTime' => 
in format format iso 1601
This is in camelCase format because it is outside of properties
The properties are "my" event-data.

currently for each test event I send
'color' => colour,
but I need to send
'color' => CSS  (several forms)

'diff-count' => diff_line_count,
needs to be split into
'diff-added' =>
'diff-deleted' =>
and also add
'seconds-since-last-traffic-light' => ...
This allows me to request a visualization where the
height of the y axis bar (on the histogram) is the
number of seconds since the previous traffic light.

-----------------------------------------------------

OneSelf.rb
how to get seconds since last 'event'
tag==1 is the first test event
so if Tag.rb had time in the same way Light.rb has I could
s_new = avatar.tags[tag].time
s_old = avatar.tags[tag-1].time
(s_new - s_old)
...
class Avatar
  def tags
    Tags.new(self)
  end
  def lights
    tags.select{ |tag| tag.has-field 'colour' }
  end
end
...and...
when avatar starts, put an entry into increments.json with the
current time which is the avatar's start time
   {
     'event' => 'created',
     'time' => [2014, 2, 15, 8, 54, 6],
     'number' => 0
   },
