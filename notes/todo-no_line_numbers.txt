Make line-numbers a toggleable feature.
When they are off it is a strong encouragement to take smaller steps.
Use check-box
Position it above the line-numbers to left of traffic-lights.


Line-numbers needs to go into its own td so that
1) it is unaffected by traffic-lights refresh on test
2) it remains visible when traffic-lights scroll all the way left

Need to restore checkbox state when test happens.
