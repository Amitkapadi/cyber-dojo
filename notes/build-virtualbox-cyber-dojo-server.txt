Creating cyber-dojo server inside VirtualBox.

Started from Linux Server iso image
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server

Created new Guest in VirtualBox, called cyber-dojo server, type=Linux, accepted settings
Clicked it to start and it asked for the image
Pointed it to the iso image I downloaded.
Responded to all the questions to setup the server.
Created a user called jon with usual password (sudoer)

Kept network settings as NAT (to enable downloads)   //to Host-only-adapter.

First fixed keyboard
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
On 1st step look for Apple option in list but then
*also* look for apple option in subsequent list.

Followed instructions at
https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/

$ wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

Recommended adding non root user to docker group as follows
$ sudo usermod -aG docker jon

Is www-data a user?
$ grep www-data /etc/passwd
Yes. So I did this

$ sudo usermod -aG docker www-data

Checking docker install
$ sudo docker run hello-world

Yes it worked.
Now simplest is to setup ssh. I will need to scp the bare repo 
at some point. On git-server
$ cd ~
$ mkdir .ssh
$ chmod 700 .ssh

Copy across credentials to git-server
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ scp id_rsa.pub jon@192.168.59.104:/home/jon/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now I can copy across the build-script
$ cd admin_scripts
$ scp setup_digital_ocean_server.sh jon@192.168.59.104:/home/jon

Now put Network back to NAT and git clone

$ cd var
$ mkdir www
$ cd www
$ git clone https://JonJagger@github.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo


$ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo
$ cd admin_scripts
$ ./setup_digital_ocean_server.sh

ifconfig says 192.168.59.104
into browser and we have a home page :-)


<aside>
Going to be painful having to switch network to NAT to git push
and then back to Host-only-adapter to run from browser.

$ git branch -r
origin/git-server-and-docker-swarm
is listed

$ sudo git checkout origin/git-server-and-docker-swarm
works

$ git status
fails because st is not a shortcut
$ sudo git config --global alias.st status
</aside>


Create/Setup page fails.
This is because I have not run admin_scripts/pull.sh
No cache.json file languages and exercises
Recreated those manually to check
$ cd languages
$ sudo ./cache.rb
$ sudo chown www-data cache.json
$ sudo chgrp www-data cache.json
Same for exercises
Still create page wont load. 
Think it is still rights.
Still need to run pull.sh

Switched back to NAT
ran pull.sh
Trying Bridges-adapter
Didn't seem to work.
Switching back to Host-only-adapter

Looked at log
Problem in LanguagesDisplayNameSplitter.rb
   no conversion from nil to Integer (for  [])
   
I think this is because there are no languages.
Switched back to NAT
$ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo/admin_scripts
$ sudo docker pull cyberdojo/gcc-4.8.1_assert

Switch back to Host-adapter
[create] and yes, I see 
one language [C (gcc)]
one test [assert]

Obviously a missing test somewhere.
If there are no languages installed the create 
setup page should simply show no languages!

Can't create dojo though. 
Think that is because one-self is not connecting.
Still on Host-only adpater. Not good.

$ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo/test/lib
$ sudo cp OneSelfDummy.rb ../../lib
$ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo/lib
$ sudo chown www-data OneSelfDummy.rb
$ sudo chgrp www-data OneSelfDummy.rb
and edit all.rb so it names OneSelfDummy.rb

And we are up. It was OneSelf.
I can now do a dojo in C/assert.


Summary
=======
o) build scripts need updating on master to fix the 
   location of pull.sh but basically works
   
o) build script should be a single script?
   instead of cloning first perhaps
   wget the script and then run it.
   
o) build script works when building from Ubuntu 14.04.2 server
   as long as you install docker first.
   $ sudo wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh   
   Perhaps I could add that command anyway.
   Is it a no-op if docker is already installed?   

o) OneSelfDummy.rb needs to be moved into lib

o) When running on a local laptop with no internet connectivity
   (Host-only-adapter) OneSelf not being visible means you
   can't do local dojos. FIX THIS.
   
o) Add test for LanguagesDisplayNameSplitter when there are no languages.

o) Create new cyber-dojo blog page on setting up a server
   from the 14.04.2 Linux Server image.


VirtualBox Note
===============
To get the git-server and the cyber-dojo server both
running with host-only-adapter and not have the same IP
address I had to tweak one of them so its apparent mac address
was different to the other one. I cloned one server from the other.


Notes
=====
www-data having to scp the bare git repo to the git server?
www-data doing this does not feel right.
www-data does not have a login shell.
Thinking I should create a cyber-dojo user on the server
and get apache2 to run the cyber-dojo rails app as the
cyber-dojo user rather than the www-data user.
Then give cyber-dojo its own home folder.
Which could be /var/www/cyber-dojo !?
Can I do this?
setup_digital_ocean_server.sh has these lines
  echo PassengerDefaultUser www-data >> /etc/apache2/mods-available/passenger.conf
  echo PassengerDefaultGroup www-data >> /etc/apache2/mods-available/passenger.conf
which suggests I can.
But... this will affect some of the language containers.
Eg C# which assumes the www-data user
Yes. See C#/NUnit/Dockerfile
