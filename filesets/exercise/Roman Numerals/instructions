Given a positive integer number determine its Roman numeral 
representation. The Roman letters are:

  I = 1
  V = 5
  X = 10
  L = 50
  C = 100
  D = 500
  M = 1000

You cannot write numerals like IM for 999. Wikipedia says
"Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit
separately starting with the leftmost digit and skipping
any digit with a value of zero."

Examples:

  o) 1990 = MCMXC
  o) 2008 = MMVIII
  o) 99 = XCIX
