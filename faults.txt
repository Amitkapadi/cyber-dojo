Resetting the focus like this allows you to carry straight on typing
at the point the left off in Firefox, Chrome etc.
However you lose the position of the cursor in IE7/8/9
I'd like this to be fixed. I tried using the jquery plugin
jquery-caret_pos.js but this just generated errors in IE's
"object doesn't support this property or method. Can't move
focus to control because it is invisible, not enabled, or
of a type that does not accept the focus. Goggling seemed
to show this is a known problem. Enough yaks.
