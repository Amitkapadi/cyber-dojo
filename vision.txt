Deliberate Practice
-------------------
I believe that the role of deliberate practice has huge untapped potential 
in the field of software development. My particularly passion is doing deliberate 
software practice in a collaborative way. Hence CyberDojo.  

Making all diff-sessions viewable
---------------------------------
At the moment you need to know the name of a kata to enter it and view
it via the dashboard traffic lights and diffs. I want a public list of all 
previous katas. 
Also, the diff-view is not stand alone. Each time you press the previous or
next buttons on the diff-view there is a new trip to the CyberDojo server.
I'd like the entire session to be viewable as a single stand-alone html file.
I'd also like a small control which automatically scrolls the diff-view of
the selected file to the next -red+green diff-section.

Branching from any traffic light
--------------------------------
I want a button which starts a new kata (without creating a new named starting 
fileset) from the state of the files at that traffic light. This will allow you 
to create a new exploratory "branch" for any new variations. 


Creating new kata filesets
--------------------------
After doing many increments you may have your files in a state you want 
to become a new named starting fileset. This would be a good way to create 
a "flying start" for a kata. So I want a button to automatically create a 
new named fileset starting point from the state of the current files.

Reliable Servers
----------------
http://www.cyber-dojo.com has an unreliable connection to the internet and sometimes
goes down. I would like to host the server on a cloud provider, eg via Amazon.

Federated CyberDojos 
--------------------
I would like lots of CyberDojo servers setup across the world.
They could be specialized to particular areas. For example Mikes CyberDojo
could be run from Oslo and host just C katas. 

Education
---------
I would like to see students using cyberdojo, and their tutors marking
their work not just based on a static snapshot of how it ends up but also
on the dynamic way it changed as it was worked on. And possibly during 
several explicit repetitions.

Recruitment
-----------
I can also imagine job applicants being asked to perform some katas
in CyberDojo (ideally with the team they are hoping to join)
and the resulting session being used to help the team judge the applicant's
suitability for the job.
