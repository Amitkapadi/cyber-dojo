                     VISION
                     ======

Deliberate Practice
-------------------
I believe that the role of deliberate practice has huge untapped potential 
in the field of software development. My particularly passion is doing deliberate 
software practice in a collaborative way. Hence Cyber-Dojo.  


Making all diff-sessions viewable
---------------------------------
At the moment you need to know the hex-id of a dojo to enter it and view
it via the dashboard traffic lights and diffs. I want a public (but
anonymous) readonly view of all previous dojos, preferably on a separate server
(but filtered so dojos with very few traffic-lights are not shown).
Also, the diff-view is not stand alone. Each time you press the previous or
next buttons on the diff-view there is a new trip to the Cyber-Dojo server.
I'd like each entire dojo session to be viewable as a single stand-alone html
file. This will enable developers to keep their own local copies, and perhaps
even put them onto their blogs.


Federated Cyber-Dojos 
--------------------
I would like lots of Cyber-Dojo servers setup across the world.
They could be specialized to particular areas. For example Mikes Cyber-Dojo
could be run from Oslo and host just C katas. 


Education
---------
I would like to see students using Cyber-Dojo, and their tutors marking
their work not just based on a static snapshot of how it ends up but also
on the dynamic way it changed as it was worked on. And possibly during 
several explicit repetitions.


Recruitment
-----------
I can also imagine job applicants being asked to perform some katas
in Cyber-Dojo (ideally with the team they are hoping to join)
and the resulting session being used to help the team judge the applicant's
suitability for the job both technically and socially.
(Some companies have told me they are now doing exactly this with Cyber-Dojo)
