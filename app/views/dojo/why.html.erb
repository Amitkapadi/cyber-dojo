Several years ago I took part in a coding dojo in the Scotsman pub in Oslo.<br/>
At the end of the dojo I was struck by a few thoughts:

<br/>
<br/>

<div>
  &bull;&nbsp;It didn't feel like a dojo should feel
  <div class="panel">
  In a coding dojo you should <em>not</em> be thinking
  about finishing the task;
  you should be thinking about <em>improving some aspect of your skill</em>.
  The practice should be repeated. The repetition frees up mental capacity,
  helping you break out of
  a completion mindset and into a practice/improvement mindset.
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  &bull;&nbsp;There was no collaboration.
  <div class="panel">
  There was a strong unwritten rule that members of a group should
  not interrupt members of other groups.
  I started to sense some of the social possibilities you could bring to a
  coding dojo, in particular, the idea of treating all the participants as a single team.
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  &bull;&nbsp;Several groups took a <em>long</em> time to get started,
  installing compilers and whatnot.
  <div class="panel">  
  I wondered what the minimum install could be for a coding dojo. 
  I realized it was <em>nothing</em>.
  You could write your code and tests in a 
  web browser and run your tests on a server. 
  The more I thought about this idea the more I liked it.
  I liked the idea of participants using something 
  that was so obviously <em>not their normal development environment</em>.
  I felt this would reinforce the idea that in a dojo
  you should <em>not</em> be doing normal development!
