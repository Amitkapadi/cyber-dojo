  cyber-dojo is for <em>practising</em> as a <em>team</em>,
  with two or more people per computer.
</div>

<div class="panel">
Practising means repeating the <em>same</em> exercise, in the
<em>same</em> language, <em>several</em> times - with
each repetition limited to fixed period of time (eg 20/40/60 mins).
The repetition might seem strange at first but remember - you are
not shipping the code, you are practising!
</div>

<div class="panel">
At the end of an iteration use the dashboard and
diff pages to replay the steps.
Everyone writes down some things
they did well and some things they could improve.
The navigator's job is to focus the next iteration
on <em>improvement</em> and <em>not</em> on finishing the exercise.
Remember, you are not shipping the code, you are practising!
