  CyberDojo is for practising as a <em>team</em>,
  with two or more people per computer.
</div>

<div class="panel">
Practising means repeating the <em>same</em> exercise, in the
<em>same</em> language <em>several</em> times with
each repetition limited to fixed period of time (eg 20/40/60 mins).
<br/>
The repetition might seem strange at first but remember, you are
not planning to ship the code you write! You are practising!

At the end of an iteration ask everyone to use the dashboard and
diff pages to replay some of the steps taken.
Ask everyone to write down a few things
they felt they did well and a few things they felt they could improve.
During the next iteration ask the navigators to try to focus the practice
on the items listed for improvement and <em>not</em> on completing the exercise.
Remember, you are not planning to ship the code!

Every N minutes ring a bell. At the bell the current
<em>driver</em> moves to a new computer (and/or new partner) and
becomes the <em>navigator</em>. (NB: This also
helps to dampen the effect of some developers dominating the keyboard.)

Every N minutes ring a bell. At the bell the current

and becomes the <em>navigator</em>, 
and the current <em>navigator</em> moves to the computer to their
<em>right</em>
and becomes the <em>driver</em>.
This means <em>both</em> members of the pair will
be at new code at every bell!

Print out <a href="/images/avatars/AllAvatars.pdf">animal badges</a>
and give each computer the badge corresponding
to their animal. If something goes wrong a computer can easily use the
resume coding where they left off as long as they know which animal they
were.
