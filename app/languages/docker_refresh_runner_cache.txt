After you have pulled a new cyberdojofoundation/language image
it will not be seen inside a *running* server.
You have to delete the runner's cache *inside* the web server
to force the web server to recreate it. Like this...

$ docker exec <WEB-CONTAINER-NAME> rm /var/www/cyber-dojo/caches/runner_cache.json

Or, you can stop/rm the web container and start it again.
