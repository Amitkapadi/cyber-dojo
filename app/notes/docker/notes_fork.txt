Random thought.
Suppose someone deleted the katas sub-folder.
People would still have src in their browser.
Does/Could the fork work even if the katas/id was deleted.
And check, [cd ../.. && rm -rf *] from cyber-dojo.sh will delete files inside data-container?
The data-container is not part of the Union File System right?
