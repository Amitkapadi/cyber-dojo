One way to make a diff URL which makes maximal re-use of the
diff-history dialog is to retain the dialog!
Viz, 
http://cyber-dojo.org/differ/diff/040706?avatar=snake&wasTag=23&nowTag=24

is to add a new render :html entry to DifferController.diff()
and to make the html page open the dialog!
Lastly, of course, I would need, somehow, to alter the dialog js
so that when < > etc are clicked they do not refresh the dialog
but instead they close the dialog and load the new URL.
This will probably create flicker.

An alternative, simpler, is to only rework the initial URL.
So that 
http://cyber-dojo.org/differ/diff/040706?avatar=snake&wasTag=23&nowTag=24

takes you to a page that opens the history dialog at the given tags.
But the URL does not change when you < > inside the dialog.
