$ sudo apt-get install tmpreaper
Googling suggests to use full path for cron task
$ what tmpreaper
/usr/sbin/tmpreaper
$ cd ~
$ (sudo crontab -l ; echo "*/1 * * * * /usr/sbin/tmpreaper -f 30s /tmp") | sudo crontab -

This runs tmpreaper every minute (*/1) and deletes all files/folders
under /tmp that have not been accessed for 30 seconds or more.
