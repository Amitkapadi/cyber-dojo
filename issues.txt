The design of cyber-dojo is very heavy on inodes. You will
almost certainly run out of inodes before running out of
disk space. I need a process that moves dojos that have
a minimum number of traffic lights and are at least 10 days
old (say) onto a separate server (or at the very minimum
into a separate folder on the same server. This ties in with
making old dojos diff sessions viewable as a stand-alone
html page (see vision.txt)
-----
Ensuring cyberdojo.sh cleans up any processes is messy. Instead of
trying to find children by walking pid/ppid hierarchy it would be
better to use pgid - process group.See lib/Files.rb
-----
The Diff view doesn't work properly in IE8.

In lib/CodeOutputParser.rb...
if a player creates a cyberdojo.sh file which runs two
test files then it's possible the first one will pass and
the second one will have a failure. Because of this the
regex's below should test for failed/error before passing.
But some of them don't do that.
And CodeOutputParser.rb with its function parse() should be
renamed based on what it does from the outside rather than
from the inside - namely it simply determines the traffic
light colour. Maybe something like
module TrafficLight
  def self.colour(unit_test_framework, output)
    ...
  end
end
-----
the various uses of eval in the code could do with being replaced with
a json parse.
-----
now that the ruby code is 1.9.3 it should be possible to get coverage
stats from the ruby tests.
-----
The intention with the installation tests is that they are used to determine
what languages are installed and to only offer those languages (at the create
page). But at the moment all the languages are being offered.
-----
The javascript tests need some TLC.
-----
The error handling at the front page is a bit messy. You get different
style popups if you enter a wrong ID compared to entering no ID.
And you also get different style popup for a wrong ID when you
click start-coding compared to resume-coding or review-coding.
There is a reason for this. It's because I want to make absolutely
sure that the new run-the-tests kata page is in a new tab/window.
It's important that there is never an operational back-button on
that page.
