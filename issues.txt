-----
Ensuring cyberdojo.sh cleans up any processes it spawns does not
always work. Instead of trying to find children by walking
pid/ppid hierarchy it would be better to use pgid - process group.
See lib/Files.rb

The Diff view doesn't work properly in IE8.

MINOR
-----
the various uses of eval in the code could do with being replaced with
a json parse.

now that the ruby code is 1.9.3 it should be possible to get coverage
stats from the ruby tests.

The intention with the installation tests is that they are used to determine
what languages are installed and to only offer those languages (at the create
page). But at the moment all the languages are being offered.

The javascript tests need some TLC.

The error handling at the front page is a bit messy. You get different
style popups if you enter a wrong ID compared to entering no ID.
And you also get different style popup for a wrong ID when you
click start-coding compared to resume-coding or review-coding.
There is a reason for this. It's because I want to make absolutely
sure that the new run-the-tests kata page is in a new tab/window.
It's important that there is never an operational back-button on
that page.
