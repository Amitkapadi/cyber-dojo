The code to ensure cyberdojo.sh cleans up any processes it spawns
could do with some attention. Instead of trying to find children by
walking pid/ppid hierarchy it would be better to use pgid - process group.

The intention with the installation tests is that they are used to determine
what languages are installed and to only offer those languages. But at the
moment all the languages are being offered.

The javascript tests need some TLC.
