The design of cyber-dojo is very heavy on inodes. You will
almost certainly run out of inodes before running out of
disk space. I need a process that moves dojos that have
a minimum number of traffic lights and are at least 10 days
old (say) onto a separate server (or at the very minimum
into a separate folder on the same server. This ties in with
making old dojos diff sessions viewable as a stand-alone
html page (see vision.txt)
-----
Ensuring cyber-dojo.sh cleans up any processes is messy. Instead of
trying to find children by walking pid/ppid hierarchy it would be
better to use pgid - process group. See lib/Files.rb
Note, if you're running under apache then this never seems to be
a problem - does apache auto clean processes?

The Diff view doesn't work properly in IE8.

MINOR
-----
Does Dir::mkdir have a -p option? If so use that instead of the
  lib/Folders.rb make_folder function
-----
the use of the sandbox folder under the animals folder could probably be dropped
  now that the execution of cyber-dojo.sh happens in a dedicated separate sandbox folder
allow entry of only first 5 characters of ID as long as its unique to that length
add help button on diff page
add help button on dashboard page
sort filenames so filenames with no . in them are grouped together
  and filenames with one or more . in them are grouped together?
sort filenames so files with the same extension are grouped together?
. . . . . . . 
$cd.renameAlert() can be refactored to use $cd.avatarImage()
upon start-coding the server could run cyber-dojo.sh and open the output file in the editor?
  certainly I don't want the output file as the one opened at the start and its empty
diff-filename-click cycles to the next diff but it loses the current red/green toggling states
in firefox clicking on the ova hyperlink in the sources dialog doesn't start a download
in diff page when you go back to a file with diff it should not cycle to next diff change
  it should only cycle to next diff change if you click the filename when the
  filename is already selected. 
-----
In lib/CodeOutputParser.rb...
if a player creates a cyber-dojo.sh file which runs two or more
test files then it's possible that the output will contain the
strings denoting red and green traffic-lights. Because of this the
regex's should test for a red traffic-light first, and for
a green traffic-light second.
Also CodeOutputParser.rb with its function parse() should be
renamed based on what it does from the outside rather than
from the inside - namely it simply determines the traffic
light colour. Maybe something like
module TrafficLight
  def self.colour(unit_test_framework, output)
    ...
  end
end
-----
the various uses of eval in the code could do with being replaced with
a json parse.
-----
The intention with the installation tests is that they are used to determine
what languages are installed and to only offer those languages (at the create
page). But at the moment all the languages are being offered.
-----
The javascript tests need some TLC.
